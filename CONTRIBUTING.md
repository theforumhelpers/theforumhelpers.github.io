# Contributing Guidelines - The Forum Helpers Website

We would love your help! Our whole site is open source, and we welcome contributions big and small if they follow these guidelines.

## How to Contribute

*Before* you create a pull request, make sure you read everything below carefully. If you do not follow these steps in the correct order, your pull request may be closed:

1. Your pull request *must* resolve an issue open, unless you are a part of the editors team. If there are no issues open that match what you are trying to do, open a new one and fill out the issue template. If you don't fully complete the issue template, your issue may be closed (See below).
2. Now that there is an issue open for the thing you would like to implement/fix, you need to wait to be assigned to the issue. By default, [@Accio1](https://github.com/Accio1/) will be assigned to your issue, unless you use the forum helpers template, which would cause [@leahcimto](https://github.com/leahcimto/) to be assigned by default. If you would like to be assigned, comment the following: "@Accio1, could I please be assigned?". Do not comment this if the issue is marked with the `in-progress` label. Now, an editor may assign you, but they also may mark the issue with the `needs-discussion` label if the issue should be discussed.
3. Now that you have been assigned, you can make a pull request. To do so, fork the repository, make your changes (it is recommended you make a new branch on your fork for these changes), then you can open a pull request by pressing "Compare" on your fork. For more information, see [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork), from the GitHub Documentation. Please do not add changes in your pull request that were not mentioned in the original issue or create one pull request for multiple unrelated issues.
4. Your pull request is up, now you need to wait for it to be approved. [@Accio1](https://github.com/Accio1/) will be requested for review by default on all issues, and [@leahcimto](https://github.com/leahcimto/) will be requested on issues relating to the Forum Helpers List. Others are now free to give their suggestions and approval on your pull request. Your pull request must be approved by an editor before being merged.
5. If your pull request is approved, it will be merged and your changes will show up live on the site! If your pull request needs changes, please make the suggested changes and then re-request review.

## Licence
When you submit code to this repository and others in the organization, it will automatically be licensed under the [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that the repository is licensed under. The license can be found [here](https://github.com/theforumhelpers/theforumhelpers.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE). By contributing, you agree to this.


## Fill out the whole issue template
The whole issue template should be filled out when you make an issue. You can write N/A if a section is not applicable, and you can write "None" in the "Additional context" section if you don't have any additional context. This is especially important for bug reports, so we can understand the bug well.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Where you think the bug may be in the code (if you think you know where the bug is located, and how to fix it, feel free to ask to be assigned)
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, fixes you tried that didn't work, as well as Browser and Operating System information)


## Follow the Scratch Community Guidelines
The [Scratch Community Guidelines](https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines) apply here and must be followed when making contributions, and when discussing on issues, pull requests and discussions. If a comment breaks the Scratch Community Guidelines, please report it. If you break these Guidelines, you may be banned from interacting with this repository.
