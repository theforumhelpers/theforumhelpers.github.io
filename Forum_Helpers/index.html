	<p class="bio">Hi there! I'm DownsGameClub. I've had a passion for being able to guide others in learning something - the forums are no exception at all. On Scratch, I'm looking to help build creative projects for things in and outside of school and of my own interests. I'm also a forum moderator on the TBG Forums (tbgforums.com/forums). Outside of Scratch, I am a fire alarm and life safety enthusiast, budding musician, and high school student.</p>

I have since begun other hobbies such as programming in Python, CGI (computer generated imagery), YouTube, website design and many more things. I still am on Scratch, just not as active as I used to.</p>

	<p class="bio">Hi, I'm VGCI! I am a teenage Scratcher who has been on this site for over 4 years. Dedicated to helping out the community, I spend my time on the forums, where I welcome new users to the site answer questions that Scratchers have, give them feedback on their projects and creations, and assist users with growing their shops. Outside of Scratch, I enjoy biking and spending time outdoors.</p>

	<p class="bio">Hia! I'm BGMead, a scratcher for over 5 years now! I've helped on the scratch forums in many ways, but I mostly hang out in the requests area to help with shops! I co-own The Come n' Leave Fast Shop, which has grown to be one of the largest shops on scratch! I wrote a now stickied post in the Help With Scripts section, which talks about other ways to receive help. I left scratch a few years ago to follow an interest in web development.</p>

	<p class="bio">Hey! I'm @bbciplayer (I named my Scratch account after a TV website, don't judge ;P). I have been a member of the Scratch community for well over 6 years. During my time on the website, I have went through times on inactivity, but I have finally returned. I occasionally make projects, and quite obviously, I love to help people out on the forums! I like pen blocks and making games and interactive projects, and I am proud to be part of the Forum Helpers! :D</p>

	<p class="bio">I started Scratch about 3-4 years ago. 2016 was the year that I started using the forums. I ran a post called the shop magazine for a long while, racking up 9 pages of shops wanting to be listed. After a year or so, I became overwhelmed and had to take and Scratch break and shut it down. In 2017, I was asked to take over the shop directory. I enjoyed doing that and found that I enjoyed helping out in the forums. Now I own the "intro to request forums" sticky and love to help people out!</p>
