			<h1>Welcome to the website for the Scratch Forum Helpers!</h1>
			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
			<p class="homeAnswers">We are a small group of people on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" class="FHULink">Scratch</a> who help around on the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/" class="FHULink">Discussion Forums</a> by answering questions, responding to bug reports, and giving our thoughts on suggestions made by Scratchers from all over the world. We don't "police" the forums, but we try our best to assist other users whenever we can.<br><br>All of us are members of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3688309/" class="FHULink">this studio</a>.</p>
			<h2>What forums are the Forum Helpers most active in?</h2>
			<p class="homeAnswers">We generally frequent the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1/" class="FHULink">Suggestions</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/3/" class="FHULink">Bugs And Glitches</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/4/" class="FHULink">Questions About Scratch</a>, and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/7/" class="FHULink">Help With Scripts</a> forums.
			<h2>I'm interested in becoming a Forum Helper! How do I apply?</h2>
			<p class="homeAnswers">We're glad that you're interested in applying! We are always on the lookout for new members! However, there is a requirement, which is that you must have at least 500 posts to apply. In order to apply, please go to the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3688309/" class="FHULink">Forum Helpers Studio</a>, and fill out the application listed in the description of the studio. Remember to read all the rules in the studio description closely.</p>
			<h3>I submitted my application! Now what?</h3>
			<p class="homeAnswers">Once you apply, a manager of the studio will check out your application and see if you meet the requirements. If you don't, you will be rejected in which case you can re-apply in a week. If your application contains all the required components, a manager will post the link in the Forum Helpers Special Actions studio and it will enter a one week "Application Pending" window. During this time, your application will be discussed by current Forum Helpers. If no one objects to you joining during this time, then your application will be accepted and you will be invited to the studio. If one or more managers object to you joining, then your application will be declined and you will be given some feedback on how to improve. If your application is declined, please wait at least one week before reapplying.</p>
