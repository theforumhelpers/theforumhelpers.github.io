			<h1>Welcome to the website for the Scratch Forum Helpers!</h1>
			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We are a small group of people on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" class="FHULink">Scratch</a> who help around on the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/" class="FHULink">Discussion Forums</a> by answering questions, responding to bug reports, and giving our thoughts on suggestions made by Scratchers from all over the world. We don't "police" the forums, but we try our best to assist other users whenever we can.<br><br>All of us are members of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3688309/" class="FHULink">this studio</a>.</p>
			<h2>What forums are the Forum Helpers most active in?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We generally frequent the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1/" class="FHULink">Suggestions</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/3/" class="FHULink">Bugs And Glitches</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/4/" class="FHULink">Questions About Scratch</a>, and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/7/" class="FHULink">Help With Scripts</a> forums.
			<h2>I'm interested in becoming a Forum Helper! How do I apply?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We're glad that you're interested in applying! We are always on the lookout for new members! However, there is a requirement, which is that you must have at least 100 posts to apply. In order to apply, please go to the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3688309/" class="FHULink">Forum Helpers Studio</a>, and fill out the application listed in the description of the studio. Remember to check in the studio description if applications are open.</p>
			<h3>I submitted my application! Now what?</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">Once you submit an application, a few of the studio curators and managers will look at your application and say if they think you would be a good fit for this group. If several curators and managers think that you would make a good fit, your application will be accepted and you will be informed and invited to the studio. If they don't think you are a good fit at this time, or if a week passes without you being accepted, then your application will be rejected and you will get a message saying how you can improve. If your application has been rejected, feel free to re apply in two weeks, keeping in mind the feedback that you were given. While your application is being discussed, feel free to look at the discussion, but please don't comment on it, or you will lose a point and your chances of being accepted will be lower. Feel free to withdraw your application at any time, but keep in mind that you will have to wait 2 weeks before re-applying if you withdraw your application. There is currently a limit of 6 pending applications at a time.</p>
