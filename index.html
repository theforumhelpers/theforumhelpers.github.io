			<h1>Welcome to the website for the Scratch Forum Helpers!</h1>
			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We are a small group of people on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" class="FHULink">Scratch</a> who help around on the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/" class="FHULink">Discussion Forums</a> by answering questions, responding to bug reports, and giving our thoughts on suggestions made by Scratchers from all over the world. We don't "police" the forums, but we try our best to assist other users whenever we can.<br><br>All of us are members of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3688309/" class="FHULink">this studio</a>.</p>
			<h2>What forums are the Forum Helpers most active in?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We generally frequent the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1/" class="FHULink">Suggestions</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/3/" class="FHULink">Bugs And Glitches</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/4/" class="FHULink">Questions About Scratch</a>, and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/7/" class="FHULink">Help With Scripts</a> forums.
			<h2>I'm interested in becoming a Forum Helper! How do I apply?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We're glad that you're interested in applying! We are always on the lookout for new members! However, there is a requirement, which is that you must have at least 100 posts to apply. In order to apply, please go to the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3688309/" class="FHULink">Forum Helpers Studio</a>, and fill out the application listed in the description of the studio.</p>
			<h3>I submitted my application! Now what?</h3>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">Once you submit an application, a few of the studio curators and managers will look at your application and say if they think you would be a good fit for this group. If all the curators and managers think that you would make a good fit, you will be invited to the studio. If they don't all agree, you can reapply in a week! You will get a comment telling you if you were accepted, as well as an invite to the studio, and if you were rejected you will get a message saying how you can improve. There is currently a limit of 6 pending applications at a time.</p>
