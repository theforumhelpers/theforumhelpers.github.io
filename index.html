			<h1>Welcome to the website for the Scratch Forum Helpers!</h1>
			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We are a small group of people on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" class="FHULink">Scratch</a> who help around on the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/" class="FHULink">Discussion Forums</a> by answering questions, responding to bug reports, and giving our thoughts on suggestions made by Scratchers from all over the world. We don't "police" the forums, but we try our best to assist other users whenever we can.<br><br>All of us are members of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3688309/" class="FHULink">this studio</a>.</p>
			<h2>What forums are the Forum Helpers most active in?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">We generally frequent the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1/" class="FHULink">Suggestions</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/3/" class="FHULink">Bugs And Glitches</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/4/" class="FHULink">Questions About Scratch</a>, and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/7/" class="FHULink">Help With Scripts</a> forums.
			<h2>I'm interested in becoming a Forum Helper! How do I apply?</h2>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px">Currently, there isn't an application process, but if three studio managers agree that you are being active and helpful on the Scratch Discussion Forums, they may choose to invite you to become a Forum Helper.</p>
